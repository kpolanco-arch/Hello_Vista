# Hello Vista

## Background

Welcome to your new screensaver! Change your environment settings for a daytime or night out mode at the beach (additional backgrounds will be added). Hello Vista is an interactive environment that lets you explore your surroundings and enjoy natural soundscapes. Youâ€™ll be able to interact with the images, add/change the music, and discover hidden gems behind objects.

## Functionality & MVP

In Hello Vista, users will be able to:

* Toggle between different backgrounds using the navigation bar.
* Drag over objects on a page to display a change in animation.
* Hover over image components to change or add to the background music.
* Use Keyboard functionality to zoom in and out of the environment.

Additionally, this project includes:

* Some of my own background illustrations.
* Daytime/Nightime mode.

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

The project uses the following technologies:
* Javascript - Interactivity and Animations
* Webpack - Bundler
* Three.js - Keyboard/functionality
